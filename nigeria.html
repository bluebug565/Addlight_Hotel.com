                    <h3>Nigreia, Bernal Heights</h3>
                   <img src="img/bernal.jpg">

                    <p>Nestled between a yoga studio and a bakery, on a quaint street in this community-centered, Bernal Heights neighborhood, is the 40-room, modern-themed, Addlight Hotel. While the primary purpose of the hotel is to house visitors from
                        around the world, a secondary, almost mandated purpose, is as a gathering place for many of the community's activities and calls to activism. No one can leave the hotel untouched by the sense of community. Our new modern conference
                        room at the Bernal Heights Landon is the talk of the town, as far as meeting rooms are concerned, but reserve soon, as availability is filling up!</p>
